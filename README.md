This is a bot paired with whatsApp and chatGBT to get the replies from the recipient and send it back to the chatGBT bot which would then send that reply back to the user. The user can send as many messages to the bot as long as the program is running and website servers are still funtional. This bot uses the location of the users messages and certain locations of chatGBT. It hasn't been tested in a windowed state but works functionally in a full size window. 

How It Works

Enter the phone number of the recipient that also includes the area code (EX: +13438881234). No need to enter dashes. It will send a message to the user right after the program is turn on letting the user know that the program is running. Only the latest message from the user after the program has messaged them will be copied. So if the user sends multiple messages the last message they sent will be the one sent to the chatGBT website. To stop the program the user can just say "stop program". Has to be exactly sent like that in order for it to terminate.
